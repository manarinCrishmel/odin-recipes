          <p class="description">
            Prepare yourselves for the pinnacle of culinary achievement: boiled
            water! This recipe is so advanced, so mind-bogglingly intricate,
            that it will leave you questioning your very existence. Are you
            ready to witness the sheer brilliance it takes to transform ordinary
            water into the extraordinary?

          <h4><b>Directions</b></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Open your cupboard or wherever it is you store your cookware.
            </li>
            <li>
              Locate a 12-quart stockpot. If you do not have a 12-quart
              stockpot, you may use whatever size pot you have; in that event,
              keep in mind that serving size here is 1 cup and there are 4 cups
              in a quart. Do the math.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place your pot in the sink under the tap. If you have never used a
              sink before, it is the large depression in your counter top. (If
              you live with someone else, they may have filled it with dirty
              dishes; in this case, wash them or simply remove them from the
              sink and place them in the oven — someone else will eventually
              discover them there and wash them.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn the cold-water knob to the "on" position. Some people (like
              my dad) prefer to let the water run a little bit. This is optional
              but encouraged — if it's a hot day or someone has previously used
              the "hot" water knob, the warmer water will eventually be replaced
              by truly cold water.
            </li>
            <li>Fill stockpot to within a couple inches of the rim.</li>
            <li>
              Lift stockpot from sink and transfer to stove. (Although
              appearances may vary, the stove is the thing with 4 or more
              circular metal bands on top of it; alternately, it may be a
              completely flat black glass surface. If you are unsure, ask your
              family, roommate, or neighbor for guidance.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Find knob on stove that corresponds to the "burner" you have
              placed your pot on. In addition to words like "Right Front" or
              "Left Rear," there are usually little pictures near the knobs to
              indicate position.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn knob to "High" and wait until water boils. Depending on
              strength of your stove and amount of water, the boiling time may
              vary. Note: DO NOT WATCH THE POT; it will never boil in the event
              that you do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boiled water may be used for any number of applications. Serve hot
              but do not drink.
